    "The topic of this report is a new compiler backend which generates NASM-syntax 64 bit assembly code. Included are a summary of the changes made to account for differences from the original MIPS architecture as well as the full code (CGx86.py and P0.py; scanner and symbol table unchanged from original compiler) and test suite used.\n",
